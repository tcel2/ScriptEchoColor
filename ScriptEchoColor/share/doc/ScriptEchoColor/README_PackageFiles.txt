Tested on Ubuntu: 
 It also works if installed at user $HOME. No need to be system wide.

Git Clone:
 Alternatively you can also keep a git clone installation udpated using:
  secEnableWithoutInstalling.sh

Untested: 
 The .deb packages, can also be extrated and installed directly on any OS that is able to run bash (and all the other required applications).
