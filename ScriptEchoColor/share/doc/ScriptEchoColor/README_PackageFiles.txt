Tested on Ubuntu: 
It also works if installed at user $HOME. No need to be system wide.

Git Clone (unfortunately there will have no download statistics):
Alternatively you can also keep a git clone installation udpated with this acompained script: http://sourceforge.net/p/scriptechocolor/git/ci/master/tree/ScriptEchoColor/secEnableWithoutInstalling.sh

Untested: 
The .deb packages, can also be extrated and installed directly on any OS that is able to run bash (and all the other required applications).
